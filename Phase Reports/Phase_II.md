## Phase II: Predictive Analysis

### Objective

In this phase, the focus is on implementing predictive analytics to address the research objectives outlined in your proposal. The analysis could involve either regression or classification techniques, depending on the nature of your problem.

### Deliverables

Each group is expected to submit a detailed report covering the following aspects:

1. **Dataset Preparation:**
    - Briefly describe the dataset used, its source, and key features.
    - Explain any preprocessing steps, such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

2. **Choice of Predictive Model:**
    - Justify the choice of predictive modeling technique (regression or classification) based on the problem.
    - Mention the algorithms used (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, etc.) and why they were selected.

3. **Model Training and Validation:**
    - Outline the process of training your model, including details like train-test split, or other techniques used to ensure robustness.
    - Present the metrics for evaluating the performance of your model (e.g., RMSE, RÂ² for regression; accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for classification).

4. **Visualizations:**
    - Include charts and graphs that effectively communicate your findings, such as feature importance plots, or model performance graphs.

### Submission

- **Deadline:** Nov 29th
- **Format:** Submit report (including visuals) in PDF format.
- **Additional Deliverables:** Upload your code/scripts used for analysis in a separate file. Ensure the code is well-documented.

This phase will serve as the foundation for Phase III, where you will incorporate prescriptive analytics to recommend actionable solutions based on your predictive findings.
